Welcome, 800G1! It's time for something exciting.

HP EliteDesk 800 G1 (she/her) used to be a non-ECC RAM and Intel Core i3 processor computer. She received an upgrade to ECC RAM and an Intel Xeon processor as a welcoming gift. She serves as a cloud drive server (Cloudreve) and Jellyfin server here. However, she often crashes.
