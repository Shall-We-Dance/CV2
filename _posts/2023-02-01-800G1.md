Welcome, 800G1! It's time for something exciting.

Meet HP EliteDesk 800 G1 (he/him), AKA **s3**. Originally equipped with non-ECC RAM and an Intel Core i3 processor, he received an upgrade to ECC RAM and an Intel Xeon processor as a warm welcome. He fulfills the roles of a cloud drive server (Cloudreve) and Jellyfin server here. Unfortunately, he often experiences crashes.
